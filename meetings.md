# Meetings notes

## Meeting 1.
* **DATE:** 2024-01-31
* **ASSISTANTS:** Ivan Sanchez Milara

### Minutes

The meeting focused on the project plan, specifically addressing the quality of descriptions. It was noted that the current functionality is somewhat limited, with the main concepts suggesting potential for expanded capabilities. The architecture diagram was reviewed.
Additionally, the discussion covered the application of APIs and their clients, along with a review of related work.

### Action points

* Expand the system's features to overcome current limitations.
* Refine the architecture diagram by removing the 'Request' element, recognizing it as an action rather than a static feature.
* Provide references for API usage, specifically pointing out actual applications or clients that integrate these APIs.

### Minutes
This meeting focused on the database design and code with Mika. The database design was appreciated. In wiki, there were relationships added in the table which were asked to be removed. On the code side, we were asked to add the on_delete behavior for the tables. Lastly we were asked to move the code for populating the DB to a CLI handler instead of implementing it in app main function.

### Action points
* relationships are not part of database table
* no on_delete behavior defined explicitly
* move database population from main() to a CLI handler
